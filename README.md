## Motivation

Fake news is a problem that emerged since the beginning of the modern information age. It spreads like a virus across the big network, and provides nothing but disinformation for the people.

Even if there are companies with a large budget investing on this field, this is a personal approach for fighting this problem, since I was not able to found a useful tool for the people that read news.

## How it works?

This is a Machine Learning oriented project. The following flowchart shows the expected use the webapp has as of now.

## Datasets

For training and testing of the model, the following Kaggle datasets were used:

- ['Fake News' InClass Prediction Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)

- ['Fake and real news dataset' by Cl√©ment Bisaillon](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)



## Running locally

This projects runs on Python 3.7.10 version.

If you manage Anaconda/Miniconda environments on your local system, you can build the project environment with:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

If you don't use Anaconda and you rather using another environment wrapper, install the project dependencies with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, run the server locally

`python manage.py runserver`
