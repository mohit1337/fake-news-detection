## Motivation

Fake news is a problem that emerged since the beginning of the modern information age. It spreads like a virus across the big network, and provides nothing but disinformation for the people.

Even if there are companies with a large budget investing on this field, this is a personal approach for fighting this problem, since I was not able to found a useful tool for the people that read news.

## How it works?

This is a Machine Learning project.
